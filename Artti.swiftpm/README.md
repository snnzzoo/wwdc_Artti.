> Your articulation helper


### üëß Introduction

Meet your articulation helper `Artti.`

As an English Education major, I have always wanted to make an app that can help kids learn.

I met a lot of kids having a hard time learning languages since Covid-19.

Because they grew up wearing masks, kids who learn by mimicking others have trouble acquiring speaking skills.

I felt we need an app that can help kids learn how to pronounce words easier and in a more entertaining way.

That's how `Artti.` came into the world!

With `Artti.`, kids can practice the pronunciation of 8 different words.

After watching the demonstration video, users repeat the word three times.

They can interact with the buttons each time they speak and utilize the front camera to improve their facial movements.

I used real world pictures correlating with every word because according to research, they tend to be much helpful than illustrated images in regards to kids‚Äô understanding.

I recorded myself saying the words so that kids can watch the mouth movement clearly.

The front camera is an option for the kids to utilize to check their mouth movement, which is actually a way language therapists use. 

The development of my app was based on the thought of wanting for better things when it came to my baby niece. I hope many kids improve their articulation using `Artti.` app.
